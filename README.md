# Linux Wallpaper Engine Extended

# The project is abandoned and supports only poorly made CPU mode, I [made a better version](https://github.com/MikiDevLog/wallpaper_not-engine_linux), and I'll leave this here, just so it's there.

A console application that outputs video, gifs and static images to the desktop background of the X11 and Wayland protocols. Made to make my [GUI](https://github.com/MikiDevLog/wallpaperengine-gui) more functional and after the development is completed will be included as an optional add-on to it.

> **Note**: This project does NOT run Steam Workshop wallpapers or Wallpaper Engine content. It's a standalone application for displaying standard media files (videos, GIFs, images) as desktop backgrounds. For Steam Workshop wallpaper support, see [linux-wallpaperengine](https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine).
