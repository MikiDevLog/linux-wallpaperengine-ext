# Linux Wallpaper Engine Extended

A console application that outputs video, gifs and static images to the desktop background of the X11 and Wayland protocols. Made to make my [GUI](https://github.com/MikiDevLog/wallpaperengine-gui) more functional and after the development is completed will be included as an optional add-on to it.

> **Note**: This project does NOT run Steam Workshop wallpapers or Wallpaper Engine content. It's a standalone application for displaying standard media files (videos, GIFs, images) as desktop backgrounds. For Steam Workshop wallpaper support, see [linux-wallpaperengine](https://github.com/Almamu/linux-wallpaperengine).

# At the moment the project is in a state of half-readiness of GPU rendering and is very stuck because of GLE and MPV which I used relying on the reference on which the project was made, so I am switching to Vulcan+ffmpeg, stay tuned for updates.
